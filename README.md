# Metagenomics Profiling

## Done
Looking at a list of ENA projects (input.txt), getting BioSample IDs. Then looking at the frequency of attributes.
Look at 'metagenome_profile.csv' to see the frequency of attributes in projects with IDs from input.txt

## Doing
Going on to look at the co-occurance of the attributes within this subset of IDs.
